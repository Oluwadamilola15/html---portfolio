        <p class="blog-content-text"><span>M</span>any companies spend lots of resources and effort to create a blog that
           supports their business, particularly the sales process. Yet many corporate bloggers complain
           that while blogs contain relevant information and attract visitors, they can’t track how their blog 
           has influenced sales. Social media has raised customers’ expectations about the information they need
           before they purchase. If your blog content is relevant to prospects’ and customers’ needs before and
           after purchase and your products deliver on their promise, you can convert your blog into a sales
           machine.</p>

             Present information based on your product offering and customers’ problems or needs.</p>
          <p class="blog-content-list-context"><span>Context.</span>While your end goal is to sell, consider the context of your
             blog posts. Here, you’re a tour guide through your firm’s extended offering – not an auctioneer. 
             Your job is to show readers how to use your firm’s products.</p>
          <p class="blog-content-list-context"><span>Commerce.</span>Once you’ve given your readers useful information in a
             meaningful setting, they may be interested in actually plunking down their credit card.
             Unfortunately, here’s where many business blogs stop. Blog editors, familiar with their company’s 
             e-commerce site and how to find specific products, can assume readers innately know how to find the product 
             or have the motivation to track it down. Don’t get me wrong. Some very small percentage of prospects will 
             to go extreme efforts to find the product. Unfortunately, the rest will just leave or worse go to your
             competitor.</p>
